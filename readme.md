# HTML5 Sandbox Demo

This is an sample project showing the sandbox features in HTML5. It is part of an blog post which will be included when ready into this project.

## Playing with the demo

Just open up _index.html_ and you will see that the page is loading untrusted.html into an sandboxed _IFRAME_ element. You can loose the applied policies by checking the various attributes, which immediately reloads the page with the modified sandbox security.
